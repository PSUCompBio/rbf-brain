Additional Files for the RBF code
RBFfinal.ipynb: Edited RBF notebook.
initialmesh.vtk: Currently the skin mesh, this is the mesh that will be morphed.
parameters_rbf_custom.prm: The input(parameters) file for the code, contains control points. Ideally this will be generated for every individual but this is a test file for the first few test runs.
